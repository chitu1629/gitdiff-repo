HELM
--------
is a package manager for Kubernetes
simplifies the deployment and management of applications within Kubernetes clusters
helm will be top of k8s
pre-requisite: k8s cluster

HELM CHART
-----------
Helm makes deploying complex applications easy by packaging them into charts. Users don't need to manually create and manage multiple Kubernetes manifests.
includes templates (in YAML/ GO lang) for K8S manifests that define the resources needed to run an appln, such as deployments, services, & configurations

A release is an instance of a chart running in a Kubernetes cluster. Each time a chart is installed in a cluster, a new release is created. 
Releases are named and can be managed independently.
"helm install" cmd creates a new release in the k8s cluster
